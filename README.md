# Data Modeling with Cassandra Project

## Premise / Problem Statement
A startup music streaming company wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results since the data resides in a directory of CSV files.

## Objectives
* Create an Apache Cassandra database.
* Test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team.

## References
* Udacity Data Engineering curriculum and template.
* Apache Cassandra docs.
